# Become a React Developer

## 01. Getting Started with React

Ways to use React:
* Create React App (good for learning or creating single-page web applications)
* Next.js (server rendered website)
* Gatsby (static rendered site)
* React Native with Expo (native applications)

We will initialise a React app (execute node package binaries): `npx create-react-app hello-react --use-npm`

We will either use live server or `npm start` to get started.

`src/app.js` can be edited to update our homepage.

You should install React Developer Tools extension in your browser.
